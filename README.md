# Tic Tac Toe Project
January 15, 2020 \
This is what I would consider my first full application using Ruby, as well as my first ever usage of classes in a project. Originally, the code was written so that on each turn of the game a similar chunk of code would run depending on whether the turn belonged to the X player or the O player. Once the functionality of the game was finished, I had to spend a noticeable time condensing the two chunks, writing new variables, changing existing variables, and checking the existing method communication to make sure that it worked as it did before. Looking back, I know that if I had just spent a little more time thinking about what I wanted to accomplish and better ways to do so I would have saved my future self a lot of frustration, time, and effort.
